Play Starhound Here: https://bkova.itch.io/starhound
My team and I released Starhound last year as our debut title. Because we were just starting out, there were only four of us with myself as the only coder. It was a learning experience for me; my first commerically available game, my first time working with Unity, and my first time working with a game dev team. I recently began to review, revise, and update the project's code for an update I hope to release soon. 

The included files here are for the player object. I remodeled all of its code in order to improve performance and remove dependencies with other scene objects. Now, anyone could open the Unity project and create a Player character with no coding required. All code is commented and documented.
